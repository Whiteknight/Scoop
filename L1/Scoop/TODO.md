# TODO

## Required L1 Items:

These items are required in L1 before we call it "complete" and cutover to L2.

1. Comments and cleanups for parser rules
1. Improve test coverage of transpiler
1. Finish expression parser conversion
1. Scoop.Cli should search all files in folder recursively from current directory

## Items we might want in L1

These items we do want to have, though it's not clear whether to put them in L1
or save them for after L2 cutover

1. Multi-dimensional array types
1. partial methods?
1. "try"/"catch"/"when"/"finally"/re"throw;" (If we want these as-is, put them in L1. Otherwise, put a replacement in L2)
1. "in"/"out" generic type param modifiers
1. "yield" enumerable methods?

## L2 Items

These items are planned for L2

1. Validation visitor
1. In-place tree updating for visitors
1. Syntax for easy explicit typing of variable declarations
1. Syntax for easy casting
1. factory/filter/strategy methods
1. Named constructors

## Probably not going to do

1. "lock" statements (only if done using a single statement instead of a block)
1. Tuple literals and destructuring assignment

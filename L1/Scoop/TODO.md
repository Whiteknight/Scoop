### C# Syntax Features

These are items from basic C# syntax we might want to recreate:

1. Multi-dimensional array types
1. partial methods?
1. "in"/"out" generic type param modifiers
1. "yield" enumerable methods?

### Transpiler Infrastructure

1. Validation visitor
2. 1. In-place tree updating for visitors

### New Scoop Syntax

1. "try"/"catch"/"when"/"finally"/re"throw;" replacement
1. factory/filter/strategy methods
1. Named constructors
1. New extension method syntax?

## Probably not going to do

1. "lock" statements (only if done using a single statement instead of a block)
1. Tuple literals and destructuring assignment

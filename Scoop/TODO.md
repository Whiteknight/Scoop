1. partial methods?
1. "in"/"out" generic type param modifiers
1. "yield" enumerable methods?

## Transpiler Infrastructure

1. Validation visitor, to verify valid structure

## Probably not going to do

1. "lock" statements (only if done using a single statement instead of a block)
1. Tuple literals and destructuring assignment

## L2 Features
